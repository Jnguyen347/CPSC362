GROUP MEETING NOTES
===================

- Briefly went over the Use Case & Data Flow Diagrams
- Discussed which detailed Use Case Description document needed to be completed, for each feature via the Use Case diagram (Only the the ones in the blue bubble)
- Discussed that we needed to divide the work between 3 sections: Employee, Cafeteria/Vendor, and Admin/Manager
- Decided that the Use Case Description document will be done in groups of 2, for each section:

///////////////////////////
Employee
• Lily
• Logan

Cafeteria/Vendor
• Nick
• Robert

Admin/Manager
• James
• Eduardo

(Flex)
• Marcus
///////////////////////////

- Posted a "Master List" document on the Google Drive project folder, so that team members could write down which Use Cases they wanted to work on & to prevent other team members from working on the same Use Case feature.
- Decided that between today (Thursday, 2/22) and to the end of Saturday, 2/24 that each sub-group would decide which Use Case descriptions they wanted to work
- Decided if that if they wanted to get a head start, they could as well & that if there were any questions, we would continue to communicate through Discord for any further questions/queries.
