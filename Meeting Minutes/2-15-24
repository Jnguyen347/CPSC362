GROUP MEETING NOTES
===================

- Briefly talked about the SRS and our previous work
- Discussed if there were any issues with Jira/Confluence
- Discussed what other parts of the SRS needed to be worked on
- Plan to talk to Professor to get a more clear & concrete idea of what our Presentation needs to have & clarification on the SRS itself

- Our goal from Thursday to the end of Saturday is:
To think about & jot down features you would want to see on our Ordering System application.
We decided that the App will have 3 different User types:
  • Employee
  • Cafeteria/Vendor
  • Owner/Admin

- Once logged in, each type of User may see & interact with different features:
• Employee may have features that involve: Making Purchases, Editing Orders, etc.
• Cafeteria/Vendor may have features that involve managing Customer Orders, Order Status, etc.
• Owner/Admin may have features that involve Managing Employee information, Managing Vendors, etc.

- We divided our 7-person team into groups of 2 and designated each team to come up with a list of features, for one of the 3 User types: Employee, Vendor, or Admin.
- Right now, the list doesn't have to be fancy or formal.
- We will discuss our ideas on Saturday, 2/17.
