GROUP MEETING NOTES
===================

- Discussed how to break up the SRS, in terms of which sections need to be worked on first
- Decided to work on Introduction & Overall Description sections of the SRS
- Decided that those sections will be a free-for-all type of effort, for the time being
- Decided that we will work on the Diagram & Requirements sections at an undisclosed later time (or perhaps when/if the Professor decides to cover the topic)
- Discussed that everyone spend this week to get familiarized with Jira/Confluence, at their own pace
- Will reconvene on Thursday, 2/15 to monitor progress before Saturday's in-class meeting
